This is a detailed summary of what each of those files do. [for the nerds]

1. Registry editor []

   - Turns off device hibernation.
   - Gives you access to advanced registry editor.
   - Sets the windows priority difference to 26, which sets foreground apps to maximum priority and background ones to lowest. This requires manual setting of priority via task manager.
   - Disables GPU power limits, accelerating performance and increases power consumption. 
   - Disables throttling due to power limitations, increases power consumption.
   - Sets maximum priority to Fullscreen Apps, accelerates performance.
   - Reduces mouse latency.
   - Closes resource hogging apps.
   - CPU optimizations.
   - Decreases delays during system processes.
   - Reduces total cacheed data.
